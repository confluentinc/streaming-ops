## The deployment mechanims might give us many properties files,
##   one for each secret for example.  We want to pass the orders-service app
##   a single properties file, so this bit will aggregate all the properties
##   files into one, in a well known place Spring looks.
##   Note: the application.properties name appears to be significant and has
##     different behavior than if you override the spring.config.location setting
#[ -d "/etc/config/orders-service/" ] && {
#  for f in /etc/config/orders-service/*.properties; do (cat "${f}"; echo) >> config/application.properties; done
#}

## Spring Kafka requires Kafka client properties to have a prefix, like the following:
##   spring.kafka.properties.sasl.jass.config
## This sed command will edit in place the properties file constructed above and prefix
##   all the lines with spring.kafka.properties, skipping the comment and blank lines
#sed -i '/^#/b; /^$/b; s/^/spring.kafka.properties./;' config/application.properties
#
#echo "starting orders-service"
#cat config/application.properties 2>/dev/null

#sleep $STARTUP_DELAY
